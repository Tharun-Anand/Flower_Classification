# Flower_Classification
Highlights Of The Project:
1)Flowers Images Dataset From Kaggle
2)Wanted to compare the prediction accuracy of classification of images of flowers using two methods
3)In the first method the architecture was A CNN network in a ResNet9 struture
4)Used A transfer Learning Approach on a pretrained resnet34 model
5)Method 1 gave 80% accuracy in contrast with 85% accuracy of method 2
